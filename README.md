# \<mkwii-igt-calc\>

Easily calculate in-game time for Mario Kart Wii speedruns.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.


## Deploying

```
$ polymer build --preset es6-unbundled
$ gulp deploy
```

This will create a build in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. Gulp then deploys the application to the gh-pages branch, which can be viewed at https://charlocharlie.github.io/mkwii-igt-calc/.
